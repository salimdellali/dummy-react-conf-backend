# Dummy React Conf Backend

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
- this project was built initially as a MERN Stack app, and hosted on heroku on the free tier
- since heroku is shutting down their free tiers (or already did, depends on the time of reading this), I had to separate this project into a RESTful API, and a Dashboard, and host them on an alternative hosting (on onrender.com)

Please check the following repos:
- [Dummy React Conf Dashboard](https://github.com/salimdellali/dummy-react-conf-dashboard)
- [Dummy React Conf Server](https://github.com/salimdellali/dummy-react-conf-server)

### Repo structure :

- Root folder `/` :
  - `dashboard/` folder : the control panel for admins of the React Conf ( using Create-React-App boilerplate ).
  - `middleware/` folder : functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server, containes `auth` function for authentification using JWT .
  - `models/` folder : mongoose models provide an interface to the MongoDB database for creating, querying, updating and deleting documents.
  - `routes/` folder : applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) to respond to requests, contains a RESTful API of the React Conf.
  - `UML Diagrams/` folder : UML Diagrams for better project description.

### Usage :

- This repo serves as the backend to the [Dummy React Conf Website](https://github.com/salimdellali/dummy-react-conf-website).
- A RESTful API is built to serve data to the **Dummy React Conf Website** and the **Dashboard** (the data is stored in a MongoDB Database).
- The **Dashboard** is made using the Create-React-App boilerplate, features include :
  - Authentification & Access Control:
    - 2 main users :
      - **admin** : has All permissions
      - **readOnlyAdmin** : has Read Only permission
  - View statistics :
    - Time left until the start of the conference
    - Number of speakers, sessions, attendees
    - ...etc
  - Perform CRUD operations on :
    - Conference information
